<b>Currently,</b> I am doing a 3-year postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/" target="_blank"><i>Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis</i></a> — <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Oslo</i></a>, where I work on the <i>Sparrow Genomics</i> project together with <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/core/glennp/" target="_blank">Prof. Glenn-Peter Sætre</a>, <a href="https://therowelab.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Melissah Rowe</a> & <a href="https://markravinet.github.io/" target="_blank">Assist. Prof. Mark Ravinet</a>. Our questions revolve around the the genomic modifications involved in the recent — and peharps very recent — evolution within the <i>Passer</i> genus.

<b>Previously,</b> I did a 20-month postdoc at <a href="https://www.aqua.dtu.dk/english/about" target="_blank">DTU Aqua</a> — <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english" target="_blank"><i>Technical University of Denmark</i></a> being advised by <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jakob-hemmer-hansen" target="_blank">Dr. Jakob Hansen</a> & <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/dorte-bekkevold" target="_blank">Dr. Dorte Bekkevold</a>. We were part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Margen_II" target="_blank">MarGen II Project</a>, and together we investigated several fish species regarding the evolutionary imprints left on their genomes caused by recent evolution in the Baltic Sea.

<b>Before that</b>, I did my MSc and PhD at the <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank"><i>Natural History Museum of Denmark</i></a> — <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Copenhagen</i></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/?pure=en/persons/295003" target="_blank">Prof. Tom Gilbert</a> & <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/research/hologenomics/gilbert-group/" target="_blank">Dr. Filipe Vieira</a>. Here, I worked on several projects on <i>Animal Genomics</i>, but especially on studies in the vein of <i>Avian Genomics</i> (please see <a href="https://g-pacheco.github.io/research/" target="_blank">Research/</a>). It was during this time that I became particularly interested in the field of <i>Evolutionary Neurogenomics</i>, specifically concerning the cognitive evolution of dinosaurs — yes, including modern birds!

<b>A morsel about me:</b> I am originally from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil" target="_blank">Brazilian Northeast</a>, precisely from a city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte" target="_blank">Natal</a> (it means Christmas in Portuguese). During my years in this tropical town, I had the opportunity to visit unique localities such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocas_Atoll" target="_blank">Rocas Atoll</a> — a marvellous place. I stayed in Natal for my initial education, and in 2011 I obtained a BSc in <i>Biological Science</i> from my Alma Mater — the <a href="https://www.ufrn.br/en" target="_blank"><i>Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte</i></a>. A few months later, right before I turned 23, I moved to Denmark to continue with my education, and I have been living in this Nordic country ever since. Despite my wonders as to what would be the cognitive status of this rocky planet if it did not have that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater" target="_blank">famous scar</a> on its surface, I see myself as a pretty ordinary person. During my free time, I enjoy reading <i>Literature</i> (especially the classics), and watching anime (my for ever favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood" target="_blank">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>).
