<b>A morsel about me:</b> I am originally from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil" target="_blank">Brazilian Northeast</a>, precisely from a city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte" target="_blank">Natal</a> (it means Christmas in Portuguese). During my years in this tropical town, I had the opportunity to visit unique localities such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocas_Atoll" target="_blank">Rocas Atoll</a> — a marvellous place indeed. I stayed in Natal for my initial education, and by 2011 I would obtain a BSc in Biological Science from my Alma Mater — the <a href="https://www.ufrn.br/en" target="_blank"><i>Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte</i></a>. In 2012, right before I turned 23, I moved to Denmark to continue with my education in Biology, and I have been living in this Nordic country ever since. Despite my wonders as to what would be the cognitive status of this rocky planet if it did not have that <a href="famous asteroid" target="_blank">famous scar</a>) on its surface, I see myself as a pretty ordinary person. During my free time, I enjoy reading Literature (especially the classics), and watching animes (my forever favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood" target="_blank">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>).
