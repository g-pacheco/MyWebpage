<b>A morsel about me:</b> I am originally from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil" target="_blank">Northeast of Brazil</a>, precisely from a city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte" target="_blank">Natal</a> (it means Christmas in Portuguese). During my two decades living in this tropical town I had the opportunity to visit rather unique places such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocas_Atoll" target="_blank">Rocas Atoll</a>, which is the only atoll in the South Atlantic Ocean — a marvellous place indeed. However, right before I turned 23, I moved to Denmark to do an MSc in Biology.
