<b>Currently,</b> I am in my hometown awaiting the results of the <a href="https://fapesp.br/17470/call-for-proposals-fapesp-grant-for-international-researchers" target="_blank"><i>FAPESP Grant for International Researchers</i></a>, which is expected to be released on the <u>13th of February 2026</u>. Meanwhile, I have been working from the <a href="https://neuro.ufrn.br/" target="_blank"><i>Brain Institute — UFRN</i></a>, sitting at a desk kindly provided by <a href="https://neuro.ufrn.br/institute/members/investigators/tarciso_ferreira" target="_blank">Prof. Tarciso Velho</a> within his lab.

<b>Previously</b>, I did a 3-year postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/" target="_blank"><i>Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis</i></a> — <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Oslo</i></a>, where I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/g-pacheco/Passersp.Genomics" target="_blank"><i>Passer sp. Genomics</i></a> project together with <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/core/glennp/" target="_blank">Prof. Glenn-Peter Sætre</a>, <a href="https://therowelab.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Melissah Rowe</a> & <a href="https://markravinet.github.io/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Mark Ravinet</a>. Our question revolved around the genomic constitution of a unique sparrow.

<b>Before that</b>, I did a 20-month postdoc at <a href="https://www.aqua.dtu.dk/english/about" target="_blank">DTU Aqua</a> — <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english" target="_blank"><i>Technical University of Denmark</i></a> being advised by <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jakob-hemmer-hansen" target="_blank">Dr. Jakob Hansen</a> & <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/dorte-bekkevold" target="_blank">Dr. Dorte Bekkevold</a>. We were part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Margen_II" target="_blank">MarGen II Project</a>, and together we investigated several fish species regarding the evolutionary imprints left on their genomes caused by recent evolution in the Baltic Sea.

<b>As for my specialised education</b>, I did my MSc and PhD at the <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank"><i>Natural History Museum of Denmark</i></a> — <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Copenhagen</i></a> advised by <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/?pure=en/persons/295003" target="_blank">Prof. Tom Gilbert</a> and co-advised by <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/research/hologenomics/gilbert-group/" target="_blank">Dr. Filipe Vieira</a>. Here, I worked on several projects on <i>Animal Genomics</i>, but especially on studies in the vein of <i>Avian Genomics</i> (please see <a href="https://g-pacheco.github.io/research/" target="_blank">Research/</a>). It was during this time that I became particularly interested in the field of <i>Evolutionary Neurogenomics</i>, specifically concerning the cognitive evolution of dinosaurs — yes, including modern birds!

<b>A morsel about me:</b> I am originally from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil" target="_blank">Brazilian Northeast</a>, precisely from a city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte" target="_blank">Natal</a> (it means Christmas in Portuguese). During my years in this tropical town, I had the opportunity to visit unique localities such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocas_Atoll" target="_blank">Rocas Atoll</a> — a marvellous place. I stayed in Natal for my initial education, and in 2011 I obtained a BSc in <i>Biological Science</i> from my <i>alma mater</i>  — the <a href="https://www.ufrn.br/en" target="_blank"><i>Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte</i></a>. A few months later, right before I turned 23, I moved to Denmark to continue with my education, and I ended up living in this Nordic country for almost 11 years. Despite my wonders as to what would be the cognitive status of this rocky planet if it did not have that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater" target="_blank">famous scar</a> on its surface, I see myself as a pretty ordinary person. During my free time, I enjoy reading <i>Literature</i> (especially the <i>Classics</i>), and watching anime (my for ever favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood" target="_blank">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>).
