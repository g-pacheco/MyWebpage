<blockquote>
So far in my scientific carrer I have mainly worked on projects in the vein of <i>Animal Evolutionary Genomics</i>. To some of these I chiefly collaborated with wetlab work, while to others my contribution was on the drylab front, and yet to other projects I wore both the wetlab and the drylab hats (that was certainly the case for those projected I led). You will find below a selected list of the projects I have participated alongside with a short explaination on how I contributed to each of them. Please notice that the order used here is arbritary, and hence does not reflect the project's importances.

#### 10K Bird Project/

<img class="ResearchImg" src="../Images/littlebirdKenya.jpg" alt="My profile image">
Pretty much unwittingly, I started working on this long-running project back in 2013 during my MSc when I was hired as a lab assistant by my advisor <a href="(https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/?pure=en/persons/295003" target="_blank">Prof. Tom Gilbert</a>, who is one of the leaders of this study. Later during my PhD also under Tom's supervision, my participation in this project was greatly expanded and I became the main person responsible for its weblab front in Copenhagen. Thus, my contribution here involved the coordination of samples (e.g. collection and shipping) alongside a considerable amount of lab work performing hundreds of DNA extractions. Moreover, I also contributed to the drafting of this article and approved its final version. I undoubtedly did learn a lot from my particiation in this large-scale genomic project, and although I no longer work on it, it is still rolling now in the genera phase. You can learn more about its current progress by visiting the project's webpage <a href="https://b10k.genomics.cn/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

This was one of the main articles that composed my PhD thesis, thus I acted as the leader author of this study from its commencement until its end.</p>

I performed crucial lab work for this project, such as DNA extractions, molecular quality checks and PCR experiments. I also contributed to the article writing process and helped its main author to finish up its final draft version based on inputs from all other collaborators.</p>

<img class="ResearchImg" src="../Images/killerwhaleFoote.png" alt="My profile image">
I performed crucial lab work for this project, such as sample acquisition, DNA extractions and molecular quality checks. I also received the leading author of this project (Dr. Andrew Foote) at our labs in Copenhagen and introduced him to some of the modern techniques that were used in this study. I also contributed to the article writing process and approved its final version together with all other authors.</p>
