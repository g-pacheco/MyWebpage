<b>24 Aug 2022/</b> Later today I will be going to Kristiansand — ¡it will be my first time in Norway! — to attent the Final <a href="https://twitter.com/Margen_II" target="_blank">MarGen II</a> Meeting. I am looking forward to meeting everyone a last time, and to hearing about the developments of all the other projects as well as presenting my own advancements. 🤓 💻

<b>17 Jun 2022/</b> I finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evolution-True-Oxford-Landmark-Science/dp/0199230854/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W927MMYDAHBX&keywords=why+evolution+is+true&qid=1655481359&s=books&sprefix=why+evolution+is+true%2Cstripbooks%2C77&sr=1-1" target="_blank"><i>Why Evolution is True</i></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Coyne" target="_blank">Jerry A. Coyne</a>. A couple os weeks ago I also finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Evolution-Theory-Science-Masters/dp/0753813688/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YR625943V7AM&keywords=What+Evolution+Is&qid=1655481454&s=books&sprefix=what+evolution+is%2Cstripbooks%2C83&sr=1-1" target="_blank"><i>What Evolution Is</i></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr" target="_blank">Ernst Mayr</a>, so it was a good opportunity to compare these two books directly. I will now read some <i>Literature</i>, but soon I will be back to my studies on <i>Evolutionary Biology</i>. 📚 🤓

<b>24 May 2022/</b> This week I am at by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea" target="_blank">Adriatic Sea</a> in Italy together with the Sparrow Group. Our intention is to catch and release many birds. The data produced out of this sampling effort will eventually be used my many researchers inclusing myself as a post-doc at the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/" target="_blank"><i>Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis</i></a> at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Oslo</i></a> in Norway. So I hope we will be seeing loads of birds in our nets!

<b>28 Apr 2022/</b> Since yesterday I have been attending the <a href="https://twitter.com/Margen_II" target="_blank">MarGen II</a> Meeting held at the <a href="https://coast.dtu.dk/english" target="_blank"><i>Danish Shellfish Centre</i> — <i>DTU Aqua</i></a> in Nykøbing Mors, Denmark. I has been great to hear the updates on all the projects. 🦪 🦀 🦞 I also presented a quick update on our <i>Baltic Sea Genomics</i> project. The weather has been amazing! 😎

<b>25 Apr 2022/</b> After being in the Northeast of Brazil for a whole amazing month on holidays, I am now back to work in Silkeborg. I have 6 months left to finalise our projects on fish 🐟 🐠 🐡 before I move to Oslo by the end of October. Work, work, work it is! 🤓

<b>01 Mar 2022/</b> I am glad to announce that I have accepted an offer to do a three-year post-doc together with <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/core/glennp/" target="_blank">Prof. Glenn-Peter Sætre</a>, <a href="https://markravinet.github.io/" target="_blank">Assist. Prof. Mark Ravinet</a> & <a href="https://therowelab.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Melissah Rowe</a>. I will be based at the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/" target="_blank"><i>Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis</i></a> at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/" target="_blank"><i>University of Oslo</i></a> in Norway. Leveraging large-scale genomic data, we will be investigating several aspects of the House Sparrow evolution. I am very excited to go back to the field of <i>Avian Genomics</i> 🐧 🦜 🐦, and also to move to a new country after more than 10 years living in Denmark 🙃 — the intended starting date is the 1st of September 2022.
